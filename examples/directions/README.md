# Google Maps Directions API Example

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/visgl/react-google-maps/main/website/static/images/examples/directions.jpg)

This is an example which shows how to use `useMapsLibrary` to load the `routes` library, and then use `DirectionsService` and `DirectionsRenderer` to find and display a route on a map.

It allows the user to choose alternative routes, updating the route being rendered on the map.

Users can also drag the markers around the map to change the route. The route is updated in real-time.

## Google Maps Platform API Key

This example does not come with an API key. Running the examples locally requires a valid API key for the Google Maps Platform.
See [the official documentation][get-api-key] on how to create and configure your own key.

The API key has to be provided via an environment variable `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`. This can be done by creating a
file named `.env` in the example directory with the following content:

```shell title=".env"
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="<YOUR API KEY HERE>"
```

If you are on the CodeSandbox playground you can also choose to [provide the API key like this](https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/environment/secrets)

## Development

Go into the example-directory and run

```shell
npm install
```

To start the example with the local library run

```shell
npm run start-local
```

The regular `npm start` task is only used for the standalone versions of the example (CodeSandbox for example)
