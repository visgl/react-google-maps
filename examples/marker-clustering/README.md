# Marker Clustering Example

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/visgl/react-google-maps/main/website/static/images/examples/marker-clustering.jpg)

This is an example of how to use the [MarkerClusterer](https://github.com/googlemaps/js-markerclusterer) library from Google to cluster markers on a map.

## Google Maps API key

This example does not come with an API key. Running the examples locally requires a valid API key for the Google Maps Platform.
See [the official documentation][get-api-key] on how to create and configure your own key.

The API key has to be provided via the environment variable `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`. This can be done by creating a
file named `.env` in the example directory with the following content:

```shell title=".env"
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="<YOUR API KEY HERE>"
```

If you are on the CodeSandbox playground you can also choose to [provide the API key like this](https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/environment/secrets)

## Development

Go into the example-directory and run

```shell
npm install
```

To start the example with the local library run

```shell
npm run start-local
```

The regular `npm start` task is only used for the standalone versions of the example (CodeSandbox for example)
