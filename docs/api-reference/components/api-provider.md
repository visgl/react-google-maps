# `<APIProvider>` Component

The `APIProvider` is our component to load the Google Maps JavaScript API.
Besides that, it provides context information and functions for the other
components and hooks of this library.

It can be added at any level of the application (typically somewhere
at the top of your component-tree), and it will render all child components
unmodified. A re-render is only triggered once the loading status of the
Maps JavaScript API changes.

Normally, there should only be a single instance of the APIProvider in a page,
but there are situations (e.g., multiple React render-roots in a page) where
this isn't possible. In those cases, make sure to create all `APIProvider`
components using the exact same props, since only the first one to
render will actually load the maps API.

When the Maps JavaScript API has already been loaded externally
(i.e., the [`google.maps.importLibrary`][gmp-import-library] function exists),
the
`APIProvider` will ignore all specified props and use the existing
`importLibrary` function.

:::info[Important]

The Maps JavaScript API can only be loaded once, and settings like the
language and region cannot be changed after loading. Therefore, it is
important to make sure the props are specified with their final values when
the `APIProvider` component is first rendered. Changing these props after the
first render will in most cases have no effect, cause an error, or both.

:::

## Usage

The `APIProvider` only needs the [Google Maps Platform API Key][gmp-api-keys] to function.
This has to be provided via the `apiKey` prop:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import {APIProvider} from '@vis.gl/react-google-maps';

const App = () => (
  <APIProvider apiKey={'Your API key here'}>
    {/* ... any components ... */}
  </APIProvider>
);
export default App;
```

## Props

The props are based on [the parameters][gmp-params] available for the
'Dynamic Library Import' API which we are using under the hood.

:::note

Most of the props below are marked with 'first-render only',
which refers to the fact that these can only be specified on
first render, later changes to the values will have no effect.

:::

### Required

#### `apiKey`: string (required, first-render only) {#apiKey}

The API Key for the Maps JavaScript API.

### Optional

#### `version`: string (first-render only) {#version}

The [version][gmp-api-version] to load (defaults to `weekly`).

#### `region`: string (first-render only) {#region}

The [region code][gmp-region] to use. This alters the map's behavior based on a
given country or territory. Quoting [the official docs][gmp-region]:

> As the developer of a Maps JavaScript API application, you are encouraged
> to always set a region parameter as various services (such as Places
> Autocomplete) tend to provide better results when the region is set.
>
> It is also your responsibility to ensure that your application complies with
> local laws by ensuring that the correct region localization is applied for the
> country in which the application is hosted.

#### `language`: string (first-render only) {#language}

The language to use.
This affects all text-content on the map, and the responses to service requests.
The default value is determined per user based on HTTP-headers sent by the Browser.

#### `authReferrerPolicy`: string (first-render only) {#authReferrerPolicy}

If your API key is configured for an entire subdomain,
you can set `authReferrerPolicy: "origin"` to limit the amount of data sent
when authorizing requests from the Maps JavaScript API.

#### `libraries`: string[] {#libraries}

A list of [libraries][gmp-libs] to load immediately
(libraries can also be loaded later with the `useMapsLibrary` hook).

#### `channel`: number

To track usage of Google Maps JavaScript API via numeric channels. The only acceptable channel values are numbers from 0-999. Read more in the [documentation][gmp-channel-usage].

#### `solutionChannel`: string

To help Google to better understand types of usage of the Google Maps
JavaScript API, the query parameter `solution_channel` can be set when
loading the API.

The `@vis.gl/react-google-maps` library will by default set
this to a generic value unique to this library (`GMP_VISGL_react`). You may
opt out at any time by setting this prop to an empty string.
Read more in the [documentation][gmp-solutions-usage].

#### `disableUsageAttribution`: boolean

To help Google understand which libraries and samples are helpful to
developers, usage attribution IDs are sent with map requests by default.
Set this prop to `true` to opt out of sending the usage attribution ID for
this library.

Individual maps can still specify custom attribution IDs via the
`internalUsageAttributionIds` prop on the `<Map>` component, which will be
used even when this option is enabled.

Read more in the [documentation][gmp-usage-attribution].

### Events

#### `onLoad`: () => void {#onLoad}

a callback that is called once the Maps JavaScript
API finished loading.

#### `onError`: (error: unknown) => void {#onError}

a callback that is called if there is an error loading
the Google Maps JavaScript API.

## Context

The APIProvider creates a context value `APIProviderContext` to be used by
the hooks and components in this library.
The context contains functions and data needed to register and retrieve
map-instances, libraries and the loading-status.

:::note

Client code should never need to interact with the context directly, always
use the corresponding hooks instead.
If you feel like you need to directly access the context, please [file a
bug report or feature request][rgm-new-issue] about this.

:::

## Hooks

The following hooks are built to work with the `APIProvider` Component:

- [`useApiIsLoaded()`](../hooks/use-api-is-loaded.md) and [`useApiLoadingState()`](../hooks/use-api-loading-status.md) to check the current loading state of the API.
- [`useMapsLibrary()`](../hooks/use-maps-library.md) to load additional [Maps Libraries][gmp-libs].
